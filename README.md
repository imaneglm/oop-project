# Database Management System

    A Java-based system implemented during my second year as a project with my classmate, where the idea was to create a system that implemented concepts learnt in OOP, which is data management. The system is implemented using Java RMI and simulates a system that focuses on server-client interaction, interface, and database management and manages an inventory of items, where the key functionality of this system includes: 
Adding products to the inventory.
Listing all the products.
Modifying product quantities (add or remove)
Querying product information.
The backend logic is achieved through Java RMI. Java RMI enables communication between the client and server remotely.

# Technologies Used

Java – core programming, server, and interfaces.
SQLite – database management (product.db).
